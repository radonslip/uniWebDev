              My Anti-Procrasination guide (for me):
            </h3>

          <p>
            For my tutorial page I have decided to compile a list of actions and stratergies that I have found help me be more productive, officialy the title of the skill I have developed is <strong>Purpose and Motivation</strong>. I have been developing these for the past couple months, for reference i'm writing this after Christmas. These were the stratergies that I found help me:

                     <div class="card-content">
                       <h4>Step 1: Maintain a normal schedule</h4>
                         <img class = "cardImg" src="images/303px-Alarm_Clock_Animation_High_Res.png" alt="Alarm Clock">
                        <p>Maintaining a normal schedule is the first key step I found that helps to combat procrasination, personally If i fall asleep at like 3 AM and wake up at 1 PM I won't feel like I wan't to do work that day</p>

                      <h4>Step 2: Change Your Environment</h4>
                      <img class = "cardImg" src="images/IMO_Sign_4423.svg.png" alt="Exit Sign">
                       <p>It's much easier to procrasnate if your environment allows it. Sometimes a change of location can make all the difference. I found that when working in Uni I was a lot more productive as I didn't have access to distractions like videogames. Depending on what you are working on, or your situation this step may be difficult to follow.</p>

                      <h4>Step 3: Just Start</h4>
                      <img class = "cardImg" src="images/320px-Macro_Biro_writing2.jpg" alt="A pen writing">
                       <p>For me I found that just starting on something, even if I didn't know exactly what I was going to do, helped me to stop putting work off. I would just open a project on my computer, and try to start on it. This doesn't always work for me, it worked better in more creative modules like Computing Industry.</p>

                      <h4>Step 4: Know when to stop</h4>
                      <img class = "cardImg" src="images//Canada_Stop_sign.svg.png" alt="Stop Sign">
                       <p>Not stopping can be just as bad as not starting. It may seem like a good idea to work 12 hours in a day to finish a bunch of work, but doing so will likely mean you either burn out, or stay up really late. Both of these undermine step 1. Doing a sizable, but not insane amount of work in a day is key.</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                      <h4>Step 5: Don't be afraid to take breaks </h4>
                      <img class = "cardImg" src="images//A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG" alt="Cup of Coffee">
                       <p>Don't force yourself to work for hours on end without a break. A break (At least for me) was best between around 15 minutes to 30 minutes. I found that under 15 minutes wasn't enough time for my brain to refresh, but over half an hour and I would likeley stop work and start procrastinating.</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                      <h4>Step 6: If you really can't start, don't (for now)</h4>
                      <img class = "cardImg" src="images/CAT_SLEEPING.jpg" alt="Sleeping Cat">
                       <p>If you have tried to start on something and you really just aren't feeling it at the moment, take a break, whether it be a few hours or even a few days. This worked for me. Just remember that deadlines should be met.</p>
